A collection of machine learning techniques we have implemented to make predictions on white stork mortality, based on a features relating to their migrations routes, environmental conditions, energy expended, etc.

We have models created in both Python and R, each in their respective folders.

Python:
  data.py: data processing
  logistic_regression.py: logistic regression model
  svm_kNN.py: SVM and kNN models

R:
  analysis_zayd.r: decision tree building
